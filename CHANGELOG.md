# Release Notes for Sprig Core

## 1.0.2 - Unreleased
### Added
- Added the `<s-verbatim>` tag that tells Sprig to not parse `sprig` and `s-` attributes in the content it wraps, useful for optimising large amounts of content that does not need to be interactive.

## 1.0.1 - 2021-10-05
### Fixed
- Fixed an error in the CLI due to an undefined alias ([#170](https://github.com/putyourlightson/craft-sprig/issues/170)).

## 1.0.0 - 2021-10-04
- Initial release.
