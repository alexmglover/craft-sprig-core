# Release Notes for Sprig Core

## 1.0.2 - Unreleased
### Added
- Added the `<s-ignore></s-ignore>` element tags that tell Sprig to ignore what they wrap from being parsed for `sprig` and `s-` attributes, for edge-case optimisation.

### Fixed
- Fixed an error in the CLI due to an undefined alias ([#170](https://github.com/putyourlightson/craft-sprig/issues/170)).
